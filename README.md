- ğŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m Rob!
- ğŸ‘€ Iâ€™m interested in becoming a better engineering manager while staying fresh with my hands on technical skills.  I don't have a CS background and I am self taught so I am learning as I go!
- ğŸŒ± Iâ€™m using this space to build prototypes, go through courses and generally experiment with concepts
- ğŸ“« You can reach me at roblkdeboer@gmail.com
