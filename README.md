- 👋 Hi, I’m Rob!
- 👀 I’m interested in becoming a better engineering manager who is slowly becoming more hands on with my technical skills.  I don't have a CS background and I am self taught so I am learning as I go!
- 🌱 I’m currently learning the MERN stack and brushing up on my JS
- 💞️ I will be looking to collaborate once I practice a bit more!
- 📫 How to reach me ...
